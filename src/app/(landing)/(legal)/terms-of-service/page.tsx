                <strong>Confidential Information. </strong>“Confidential

                made available by Gateway hereunder, whether oral or in writing
                (including electronic transmission) that: (i) is designated as
                “Confidential” or “Proprietary” or similar marking by Gateway at
                the time of disclosure or within a reasonable period thereafter;
                (ii) concerns business, financial, technical, marketing, or
                other proprietary information of Gateway; or (iii) by the nature
                of the circumstances surrounding disclosure, or the information
                itself, should be treated as confidential. All non-public
                components of the Services (including without limitation
                information concerning or embodied in SDKs or APIs) are Gateway
                Confidential Information. You shall retain Confidential
                Information in strict confidence and shall not use Confidential
                Information except for purposes permitted under these Terms. You
                may be entitled to disclose Confidential Information on a
                need-to-know basis to your employees, agents, and contractors
                who are authorized to access such information, provided that the
                same are bound by non-disclosure and confidentiality obligations
                no less protective than those set out in these Terms. You shall
                use at least the same degree of care in safeguarding the
                Confidential Information as you use in safeguarding your own
                confidential information of a similar nature, but shall not use
                less than reasonable care. You will be responsible for any
                breach of these obligations as a result of the acts or omissions
                of your employees, agents, and contractors, including any other

                becomes available to you on a nonconfidential basis from a third

                obligation of confidentiality to Gateway with respect to such
                Confidential Information; or (iii) was independently developed
                by you without reference to the Confidential Information. If you
                are legally required to disclose Confidential Information in a
                legal or regulatory proceeding, you must notify Gateway
                immediately (unless legally prohibited from doing so), and if
                you do not seek or obtain appropriate remedies prior to
                disclosure, you may disclose only the portion of that
                Confidential Information you reasonably believe you are legally
                required to disclose after exercising reasonable efforts to
                obtain confidential treatment of that information.

                    written notice to the other party reasonably identifying the

                defend you from and against any thirdparty claim, action, suit,
                or proceeding to the extent resulting from assertions that the
                Services misappropriate or infringe the IP Rights of an

                to modify the Services or obtain licenses necessary to resolve
                such third-party infringement claims. If Gateway determines that

                be entitled to terminate these Terms without further liability
                to you. The foregoing states the entire liability of Gateway,

                from and against any claim, action, suit, or proceeding by a

                End User) to the extent resulting from (i) your breach of the
                representations and warranties set forth in Section 10.3 above

                reasonable written notice of any claim, action, suit, or
                proceeding for which the indemnified party is seeking
                indemnification; provided, however, that any failure to provide
                such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its
                obligations under this Section 12 (Indemnification) except to
                the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced
                by such failure. In the event of a claim under this Section 12
                (Indemnification), the indemnified party shall: (i) grant
                control of the defense and settlement to the indemnifying party,
                provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not enter
                into any settlement that admits fault or liability of the
                indemnified party without the indemnified party’s prior written
                consent; and (ii) reasonably cooperate with the indemnifying
                party at the indemnifying party’s expense. The indemnified party
                is entitled to participate in defense at its own expense with
                counsel of its choosing.

                </strong>
                These Terms and the Services shall be governed and construed in
                all respects in accordance with the laws of the State of New
                York without regard to any conflict of laws principles. The
                Services are operated from the United States and may not be
                appropriate in other jurisdictions. Access to or use of any
                Services from jurisdictions where such access or use is illegal
                is strictly prohibited. You are always responsible for your
                compliance with applicable laws in connection with the Services.
                Excluding disputes addressed through arbitration as provided
                below, you agree to submit the claim (whether in tort, contract,
                statutory, or otherwise), dispute, disagreement, or controversy
                concerning the existence, breach, interpretation, application,
                or termination relating to, or arising under these Terms (a
                “Claim”) to the exclusive venue jurisdiction of the state and
                federal courts located in New York for the purpose of litigating
                the Claim, and you hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction
                and venue thereof and waive any right to transfer whether due to
                forum nonconveniens or other reason. The parties shall use their
                best efforts to settle any Claim directly through consultation
                and good faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to
                you initiating arbitration against Gateway. If you are unable to
                informally resolve any Claim with Gateway, such Claim shall be
                submitted to binding, confidential arbitration. Excluding a
                Claim by Gateway for injunctive or other non-monetary relief,
                all Claims shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration by
                a single arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Inc. Streamlined
                Arbitration Rules & Procedures then in effect. The decision of
                the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties.
                Judgment on any award(s) rendered by the arbitrator may be
                entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Nothing in
                this section shall prevent either party from seeking immediate
                injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, and
                any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with the
                agreement to arbitrate or a waiver of the right to arbitrate.
                The parties agree that all awards in their arbitration, together
                with all confidential information, all materials in the
                proceedings created for the purpose of the arbitration and all
                other documents produced by the other party in the proceedings
                and not otherwise in the public domain shall be treated and
                maintained as confidential, except to the extent that disclosure
                may be legally required of a party or necessary to protect or
                pursue a legal right or to enforce or challenge an award in
                legal proceedings before a court or other judicial authority.
                The arbitration shall take place in New York, New York or, at
                the option of the party seeking relief, online, by telephone,
                via written submissions alone or in your state of residence if
                requested, and be administered by JAMS provided however, that in
                the event that five (5) or more individuals seek to initiate (or
                do initiate) arbitration proceedings against Gateway in a
                coordinated or related manner (e.g., coordination among
                plaintiffs or their counsel in regard to similar claims), then
                instead of such arbitrations being administered by JAMS, Gateway
                may elect to consolidate such arbitrations before an arbitrator
                mutually agreed-upon by the parties (and terminate any pending
                administration by JAMS), with such arbitrator being a retired
                federal or state judge and experienced with the subject matter
                of the arbitration. In such an event, except with respect to
                administration of the arbitration proceedings, the arbitrator
                shall follow JAMS Inc. Streamlined Arbitration Rules and
                Procedures. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE
                LAW: YOU AND GATEWAY AGREE THAT, EXCEPT FOR CONSOLIDATED
                ARBITRATION AS PROVIDED ABOVE, (i) EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST
                THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR GATEWAY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY,
                RESPECTIVELY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
                PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND (ii) UNLESS BOTH
                YOU AND GATEWAY AGREE, NO JUDGE MAY CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE
                PERSON’S CLAIM OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A
                REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.

                <strong>Assignment.</strong> These Terms are not assignable by
                you without Gateway’s prior written consent. Gateway may assign
                any of its rights or delegate any of its duties under these
                Terms without the prior written consent of Authorized Users,
                including with respect to an assignment in whole as part of
                Gateway’s merger, change of control or other combination by
                operation of law of all or substantially all of its business and
                assets. Any purported assignment in breach of this assignment
                provision will be null and void.

                these Terms and for Gateway’s other internal business purposes,

                compile, analyze, and otherwise use Account Registration Data
                and any other metadata generated by your use of the Services,
                for Gateway’s internal business purposes or otherwise as
                permitted by applicable law, including to secure and to improve
                the Services. You confirm that you have no expectation of

                <strong>Force Majeure. </strong>Neither party shall be liable
                hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in the performance
                of its obligations, other than payment obligations, due to any
                cause which is beyond its reasonable control and not avoidable
                through the exercise of reasonable diligence, including, by way
                of example, but only to the extent beyond the reasonable control
                of a party and not avoidable through the exercise of reasonable
                diligence: strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, fires,
                flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, terrorism, war,
                governmental action, earthquakes, pandemics and other public

                <strong>Independent Contractors.</strong> The parties are
                independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, joint
                venture, or employer-employee relationship is intended or
                created by these Terms. Neither party shall have the power to
                obligate or bind the other party.

                <strong>Severability; Waiver; Headings. </strong>Any provision
                of these Terms determined to be unenforceable or invalid by
                applicable law or court decision shall not render these Terms
                unenforceable or invalid as a whole and, in such event, such
                provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best
                accomplish its objectives within the limits of applicable law or
                court decision. A party’s failure to require the other party’s
                performance of any obligation herein shall not affect the full
                right to require such performance at any time thereafter. A
                party’s waiver of the other party’s breach of any obligation
                under these Terms shall not be taken or held to be a waiver of
                the obligation itself or of any past or subsequent breaches of
                the same obligation. Headings used in these Terms are for
                reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe,
                or describe the scope or extent of such section or in any way
                affect these Terms.

                the parties as to the subject matter of these Terms. Neither
                party is relying on any warranties, representations, assurances,
                or inducements not expressly set forth herein. These Terms may
                be changed only by a writing signed by both parties.

                any termination or expiration of these Terms: 1, 3.1(ii) and
